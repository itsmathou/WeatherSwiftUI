# Weather Swift UI

This is a sandbox app to learn about Swift UI & Combine with the [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev). The minimum target deployment is iOS 14 due to some Property Wrappers used.
To use this project, you will need:
- Xcode 12
- A private key from Dark Sky set up in the `Keys` folder as follow
```
struct DarkSky {
    static let key: String = "yourKeyHere"
}
```
